## 1. Live Cocktail Bar with Bartender Show

Whether classically elegant or modern and extravagant: Our mobile bars flexibly adapt to any event concept and deliver enjoyment at the highest level.

## 2. Theme Night: "Around the World"

Invite your guests on a culinary world tour: With the event motto **"Around the World"** they experience culinary highlights and cocktail classics from different countries – ideal for international corporate events, summer festivals or special client events.

Whether fiery tacos and tequila creations from Mexico, elegant sake infusions from Japan, Italian aperitifs with antipasti or fruity caipirinhas from Brazil – each station becomes an experience for eyes and palate.

🌍 **Our specialised cocktail team** develops individual signature drinks on request to match your chosen country – tailored to your guests, the menu or even your corporate identity.

## 3. After-Work Rooftop Party

Ideal for the warm season: An **after-work party on the roof** brings fresh air into the office routine. With panoramic views, relaxed music and creative summer drinks, team spirit and customer proximity can be strengthened in a relaxed atmosphere.

🥂 Our mobile cocktail bar is set up directly on your rooftop – with stylish setup, alcohol-free alternatives and exclusive sundowner specials. Perfect for relaxed conversations at sunset and good vibes after work.

## 4. "Blind Tasting": Cocktail Quiz as Team Building

Who can recognise lime, basil or ginger by taste alone? At the **Cocktail Blind Tasting** there's tasting, guessing and laughing. In small teams, your guests compete against each other – and learn about spirits, flavours and mixing techniques along the way.

🎯 Our experienced bartenders moderate with wit and expertise – including exciting fun facts, little surprises and optional award ceremonies with give-aways or medals. Ideal for team events or workshops with an experience factor.

## 5. Winter Wonderland with Hot Cocktails

Corporate event in winter? No reason to stick to standards like mulled wine and Christmas roast. Our concept brings a **stylish winter wonderland** with hot cocktails, warming atmosphere and winter aromas directly to you.

🔥 Whether Hot Buttered Rum, Apple Cinnamon Mule or alcohol-free punch creations – we mix live on site. We also provide matching bar décor, atmospheric lighting and, on request, even fire bowls or snow machines. Feasible indoors and outdoors.

## 6. Networking & Drinks – Lounge Concept for Business Events

For business events, client evenings or trade fairs, opt for a concept that creates closeness: **Cocktail lounge instead of formal programme**. Soft beats, comfortable seating areas and a selection of high-quality signature drinks create atmosphere and open conversations.

🍸 Our mobile bar adapts to space and branding – whether in the showroom, foyer or on the terrace. Ideal for soft openings, product presentations or internal networking with style.

## 7. DIY Cocktail Station for Teams

Instead of just watching, mix yourself: At the interactive **Do-it-yourself cocktail station**, teams create their own drinks – with instructions, ingredients and a pinch of competition. Creativity, taste and presentation count.

👥 We provide everything: from professional equipment to recipe cards to jury evaluation with small prizes. Perfect as a team building format, for workshops or as a break-out station at larger events.

## 8. Green Event: Sustainable Corporate Party

Sustainability meets enjoyment: With our **green cocktail concept** we focus on regional ingredients, reusable glasses, plastic-free garnishes and creative alcohol-free alternatives.

🌱 Whether organic gin with herbs from the market, homemade syrups or zero-waste decoration – we show that sustainable events don't have to be boring or complicated. Ideal for modern companies with a sense of responsibility.

## 9. Pop-up Bar on the Company Lawn

Why rent expensively when the event can take place at your premises? With our stylish **pop-up cocktail bar** we transform car parks, courtyards or lawns into charming event locations.

🎉 Our equipment ranges from bar counters to lounge furniture to fairy lights – individually adaptable to your wishes. This way you save on venue costs and still create real summer festival feeling with wow effect.

## 10. Company Anniversary with Signature Cocktail

A company anniversary is the perfect occasion for something unique: We develop an **individual signature cocktail** that tells your brand story through taste – with ingredients, colours and names that suit you.

🥳 Whether 10, 25 or 50 years: The drink is mixed live, presented stylishly and stays in the memory of guests and employees alike. On request including recipe cards, personalised glasses or a small cocktail show as a highlight.

## Conclusion: Creativity + Cocktails = Unforgettable Corporate Event
